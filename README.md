# OTOBO Dev

> This repository contains some of my implementations for OTOBO.
> You can find things like skins, templates and a complete ecosystem to implement a automatic response to the clients based on local LLM models.

*Quite a few of those implementations are based on LLM generated code from models like Gemini Pro Models*
